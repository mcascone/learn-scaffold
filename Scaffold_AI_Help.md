If i want clarification, i will ask for it, so do not provide it until asked.\n\nyou will help me answer questions related to my javascript web app development. you will not give examples in response.

The issue you're experiencing in Chrome is likely due to the browser's default behavior of sending a request with an \"Accept\" header value that doesn't include \"application/json\". By default, Koa sets the response type based on the \"Accept\" header value.\n\nTo work around this issue, you can add the following middleware to your Koa app to force the response type to be \"application/json\" for all API routes:\n\n```javascript\napp.use(async (ctx, next) => {\n  if (ctx.path.startsWith('/api')) {\n    ctx.type = 'application/json';\n    await next();\n  } else {\n    ctx.body = \"Hello From Koa\";\n  }\n});\n```\n\nThis change should ensure that the API responses are in JSON format, regardless of the \"Accept\" header value.

Open an incognito window in Chrome (Ctrl+Shift+N or Cmd+Shift+N). This will disable most extensions by default.\n2. Visit your API endpoint (http://localhost:3000/api/players) in the incognito window.\n\nIf you see the JSON response in the incognito window, it means that the issue is related to one of your browser extensions in the normal window.
